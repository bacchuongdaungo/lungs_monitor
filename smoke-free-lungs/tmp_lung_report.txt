Human lung anatomy and motion for a realistic,
BPM-driven lung visualization
Executive summary
A scientifically grounded “breathing” animation is best modeled as a time-varying  lung volume curve
driven by respiratory rate (breaths per minute; often abbreviated RR or brpm) and tidal volume (TV), with
deformation dominated by diaphragm descent (vertical expansion) plus rib cage expansion (transverse
+  anteroposterior).  In  normal  quiet  breathing,  inspiration  is  primarily  active  (diaphragm/external
intercostals) and expiration is largely passive (elastic recoil). 
For anatomically accurate region selection, the practical convention is to define selectable regions as lobes
(RUL/RML/RLL,  LUL/LLL)  and  optionally  bronchopulmonary  segments (≈10  right,  ≈8–9  left).  These
regions  have  clinically  stable  boundaries  (fissures  for  lobes;  segmental  bronchus-based  partitions  for
segments) and map cleanly to either (a) separate meshes in 3D, or (b) SVG/Path2D masks in 2D that can
deform along with the visual. 
To  avoid  “redrawing  lungs  forever ,”  the  highest-leverage  move  is  to  adopt  3D  lung  assets (preferably
already  split  into  lobes/segments  or  with  identifiable  submeshes),  convert  them  to  glTF/GLB for  web/
mobile runtime loading, and drive breathing via blend shapes (morph targets) or a lightweight parametric
deformation (scale/translate/shear) that approximates diaphragm + chest wall mechanics. glTF is explicitly
designed  for  efficient  runtime  delivery;  you  can  further  reduce  size  with  mesh  decimation  and  Draco
compression. 
Key anatomy for realistic visuals and selection masks
Human lungs are asymmetric but follow a consistent topography: each lung has an  apex (superior), a
concave base resting on the diaphragm, and named surfaces/borders that are stable landmarks for 2D/3D
mapping. The left lung has a cardiac notch along the anterior border (space for the heart), which is useful
as a “signature shape feature” for selection and silhouette matching. 
The lobar anatomy is the first “sweet spot” for region selection: - Right lung: upper (RUL), middle (RML),
lower  (RLL),  separated  by  horizontal and  oblique fissures.  -  Left  lung: upper  (LUL)  and  lower  (LLL),
separated by an oblique fissure. 
If  you  need  finer  granularity,  lungs  subdivide  into  bronchopulmonary  segments,  each  supplied  by  a
segmental (tertiary) bronchus; these are commonly listed as ~10 segments on the right and ~8–9 on the
left, with some naming variation on the left. This segmentation is clinically meaningful, and the bronchial
tree hierarchy (trachea → main bronchi → lobar bronchi → segmental bronchi) gives you a principled way to
define region IDs beyond “random circles.”

The  pleura matters for motion modeling: lungs are covered by  visceral pleura and the thoracic wall by
parietal  pleura,  with  a  thin  pleural  space  that  enables  low-friction  sliding.  Many  teaching  sources
emphasize that lungs are “passive” in the sense that ventilation is driven by thoracic/diaphragm movement,
with the lung following due to pleural coupling. This directly supports an animation strategy where you
simulate diaphragm/chest wall deformation rather than “lungs magically expanding themselves.” 
Practical landmarks to bake into 2D/3D selection masks (high utility, low controversy): - Apex vs base (base
conforms  to  diaphragm  dome).  -  Anterior  border  +  cardiac  notch (left).  -  Hilum/root  region (where
bronchi/vessels enter), typically medial; useful as a “non-selectable anchor zone” for stable UI placement.
Respiratory mechanics and mapping BPM to a volume curve
A  realistic  breathing  loop  needs  three  coupled  elements:  rate,  timing  (inspiratory  vs  expiratory
duration), and amplitude (tidal volume).
Baseline adult parameter ranges (typical, not diagnostic): - Resting respiratory rate: commonly cited in
the ~12–20 breaths/min range for adults at rest. 
- Tidal volume: often summarized around ~0.5 L per breath (≈500 mL) in an average adult male and ~0.4 L
(≈400 mL) in an average healthy adult female during quiet breathing. 
- Anatomical dead space: often approximated as ~150 mL (conducting airways), which is why shallow rapid
breathing is inefficient for gas exchange. 
-  Inspiratory:expiratory  timing:  a  commonly  taught  “normal”  I:E  is  approximately  1:2 (expiration  ~2×
inspiration), with longer expiration in obstructive disease contexts. 
Mechanics  you  can  map  to  transforms: -  Diaphragm  contraction  increases  the  vertical  thoracic
dimension (central tendon pulled inferiorly; diaphragm flattens). 
- Rib motion increases transverse (bucket-handle) and anteroposterior (pump-handle) dimensions. 
- Quiet expiration is typically passive recoil after inspiratory muscles relax. 
Magnitude  for  “how  much  things  move”: diaphragm  excursion  measured  by  ultrasound  in  healthy
populations is on the order of a couple cm during quiet breathing, increasing with deep breathing; one
large reference study reports mean excursions around ~2.3 cm during quiet breathing and ~5.3–5.5 cm
during deep breathing (supine ultrasound), and also summarizes classic ranges like ~1–2 cm tidal vs ~7–11
cm deep inspiration. 
Driving the loop from BPM: if bpm means breaths per minute, cycle time is T = 60 / bpm seconds.
Using I:E ≈ 1:2 gives inspiratory duration Ti ≈ T/3 and expiratory duration Te ≈ 2T/3. 
Example: BPM → volume curve (TS-style pseudocode)
// bpm: breaths per minute (respiratory rate)
// tv: tidal volume in liters (e.g., 0.5 at rest)
// ie: inspiratory:expiratory ratio, e.g., 1:2 => ieI=1, ieE=2
functionlungVolumeLiters(tSec: number, bpm: number, tv: number, ieI= 1, ieE=

2) {
constT = 60/ bpm; // cycle duration
constphase= ((tSec% T) + T) % T;
constTi= T * (ieI/ (ieI+ ieE));
constTe= T - Ti;
// Smooth inhale: half-cosine from 0 -> tv
if(phase< Ti) {
constx = phase/ Ti; // 0..1
returntv* 0.5* (1 - Math.cos(Math.PI* x));
}
// Passive-ish exhale: exponential decay from tv -> 0
// k controls "how fast" you empty; choose k so curve hits near 0 at Te
consty = (phase- Ti) / Te; // 0..1
constk = 4.0;
returntv* Math.exp(-k * y);
}
This structure matches the idea that inspiration is actively shaped while expiration can be modeled as
recoil/decay. 
If you want to “deduce BPM from body metrics”: physiology references note that heart rate, respiratory
rate, and tidal volume all tend to increase with metabolic demand/activity, but inferring breathing rate from
heart  rate  alone  is  not  reliably  person-invariant.  A  pragmatic  app  convention  is:  let  users  input  brpm
directly,  or  select  “rest  /  normal  activity  /  exercise,”  using  published  nominal  defaults  (e.g.,  a  paper
summarizing 12 bpm & 0.5 L at rest, and higher values for activity). 
Region mapping and anatomically accurate selection
The core requirement is: whatever deforms visually must also deform for hit-testing, otherwise the user
will tap “lower lobe” and hit an old mask.
Coordinate systems you’ll encounter and how to not get wrecked
If you source models from medical imaging (CT/MRI segmentations), coordinate conventions matter: -
DICOM and most medical imaging software commonly store patient-space in LPS (Left–Posterior–Superior).
- 3D Slicer  uses an internal RAS convention (Right–Anterior–Superior), which is closely related to LPS but
differs by axis sign flips in the first two axes. 
- glTF defines a right-handed coordinate system with +Y up and +Z forward (units in meters). 
- Some NIH3D downloads explicitly mention  Y-up vs  Z-up depending on authoring tools and conversion
paths, so you should treat “model up-axis” as asset metadata, not an assumption.

A professional convention is to define one canonical coordinate space for your app (often glTF space in
meters  for  web),  and  write  explicit  conversion  utilities  when  importing  medical-source  meshes/
segmentations. 
Replacing circles with anatomy-following masks
You have three viable mask strategies, ordered from simplest to most scalable:
SVG path regions (2D-first):
Create separate SVG <path>s for each lobe (and optionally segments). The browser’s SVG hit-testing uses
shape geometry, and APIs like  SVGGeometryElement.isPointInFill() /  isPointInStroke() can
support programmatic hit tests. 
This is the cleanest if your product stays 2D and your deformation is limited to transforms or path morphs.
Canvas Path2D polygonal masks (2D with manual control):
Store  each  region  as  a  Path2D and  use  CanvasRenderingContext2D.isPointInPath() (and
isPointInStroke) for accurate hit detection even with complex shapes. 
This is ideal if you want a single canvas pipeline (draw + hit-test) and consistent behavior across browsers.
3D mesh picking (3D-first, best for realism):
Split  the  lungs  into  distinct  meshes:  right_upper_lobe,  right_middle_lobe,  …  Then  selection
becomes “which mesh did the ray hit?” Most engines support ray-based picking (Three.js Raycaster , Babylon
picking, react-three-fiber event system). 
The professional “don’t fight the math” approach for anatomy-following selection is: make lobes/segments
distinct  nodes  in  the  scene  graph,  so  picking  returns  a  stable  region  ID.  This  avoids  fragile  2D
approximations when the lung deforms in 3D. 
Animation model for realistic lung motion
A realistic aesthetic comes from matching where motion happens (spatial distribution) and how it changes
over time (temporal waveform).
Parametric breathing curve choices
A sinusoid is a good baseline, but multiple physiology sources emphasize that inspiration and expiration
differ mechanically (active vs passive), which supports an  asymmetric waveform (faster inhale, slower
recoil exhale). 
The  piecewise  cosine  +  exponential  example  earlier  is  a  simple  approximation  consistent  with  those
mechanisms. 
Amplitude scaling by tidal volume and regional deformation
At-rest nominal values like ~0.5 L per breath are widely cited, and a published synthesis provides concrete
“nominal” parameter sets across rest/activity (e.g., rest 12 bpm & 0.5 L; higher during activity/exercise).

For spatial realism, don’t inflate the lung uniformly. A physiology reference notes that ventilation is greater
at the base than the apex (explained via pleural pressure gradients and regional compliance), which you
can translate into a deformation gradient: larger displacement near the diaphragmatic/base region, smaller
near the apex. 
Mapping the curve to 2D/3D transforms
A robust “good-enough realism” mapping is: -  Vertical expansion: translate lung base inferiorly during
inspiration (diaphragm descent proxy) and slightly compress upward during expiration. 
- Transverse expansion: scale X outward (bucket-handle proxy). 
- Anteroposterior expansion: subtle scale/translation in Z (pump-handle proxy). 
If you need higher realism in 3D without simulating tissue physics, blend shapes (morph targets) authored
from an “exhale mesh” and an “inhale mesh” typically give the best cost/benefit, because the artist (or
offline tool) can embed non-linear deformation once and runtime just interpolates. The idea aligns with
NIH3D workflows that describe segmentation → polygonal model → optimization/remeshing in DCC tools
(e.g., ZBrush) for downstream use. 
Optional: phase offsets between lobes
In  healthy  quiet  breathing,  it’s  reasonable  (and  simplest)  to  keep  lobes  in-phase  but  with  different
amplitudes; published physiology focuses more strongly on regional magnitude differences than consistent
“cartoon lag.” 
If you want subtle phase offsets, historical literature reports measurable regional timing differences under
certain conditions (e.g., airway closure dynamics), but this is niche enough that you should treat it as an
optional stylistic enhancement rather than a universal truth.

Important licensing gotcha for a smoking-cessation app: some commercial 3D licenses explicitly restrict
use in content that promotes “tobacco,” and some licenses also restrict redistribution or extraction of
source assets. Even if your intent is anti-smoking, you should treat this as a red-flag clause and pick safer
assets (e.g., CC-BY biomedical models) or get legal clarity. 
Concrete NIH3D lung assets that match your use case
NIH3D includes a “Lung, Male” reference organ distributed as GLB with a CC-BY label and notes that lung
lobes and intrapulmonary bronchi are included (with certain upper-airway parts removed in a version). 
Another NIH3D “Respiratory System (Lungs) – Visible Human Male” entry documents downloadable  FBX
(separated  pieces  +  merged  variants),  plus  printable  STL,  and  explicitly  describes  coordinate-system
differences across exported files.

Making 3D assets lightweight for web/mobile
Use  glTF/GLB as the runtime format: it’s royalty-free and designed to minimize asset size and runtime
processing. 
Then  apply:  -  Mesh  decimation  /  LOD (reduce  triangles  for  mobile  and  low-end  GPUs).  -  Draco
compression via the KHR_draco_mesh_compression extension when size dominates load time. 
- Post-processing tools like  glTF Transform for reproducible optimization pipelines (rather than manual
“export roulette”). 
Implementation guidance, performance, and UX safety
Web stack and interaction
For web/PWA, the common professional stack is: - Three.js + GLTFLoader for loading GLB/glTF. 
- Or Babylon.js for a batteries-included engine with glTF importer support. 
- Or React Three Fiber if you are already in React and want declarative scene composition + event
handling. 
For selection, ray-based picking is standard: - Three.js supports mouse picking via Raycaster . 
- WebGL object/region picking can also be done by rendering an offscreen ID buffer (color-coded picking), a
well-documented technique in WebGL tutorials. 
Example: converting a 3D lung region into a 2D selection mask
You can generate a deforming 2D mask from the 3D scene itself each frame (or when needed) by rendering
just the region meshes into an offscreen render target:
// Pseudocode for a Three.js-like pipeline
// Goal: build a 2D mask (ImageData) for a specific region ID.
// Technique: offscreen render with flat colors (ID buffer), then read pixels.
asyncfunctionrenderRegionMask({
renderer, scene, camera, width, height,
regionMeshes, // array of meshes, each mapped to regionId
targetRegionId
}){
// 1) Create offscreen render target
constrt= newWebGLRenderTarget(width, height);
// 2) Swap materials to flat-ID colors
constoriginalMats= newMap();
for(constmeshofregionMeshes) {
originalMats.set(mesh, mesh.material);
mesh.material= newMeshBasicMaterial({color:
encodeIdColor(mesh.userData.regionId) });
}

// 3) Render to offscreen buffer
renderer.setRenderTarget(rt);
renderer.clear();
renderer.render(scene, camera);
// 4) Read pixels and build boolean mask
constpixels= newUint8Array(width* height* 4);
renderer.readRenderTargetPixels(rt, 0, 0, width, height, pixels);
constmask= newUint8Array(width* height);
consttargetColor= encodeIdColor(targetRegionId);
for(leti = 0; i < width* height; i++) {
constr = pixels[4*i],g = pixels[4*i + 1],b = pixels[4*i + 2];
mask[i] = (r ===targetColor.r &&g ===targetColor.g &&b ===
targetColor.b) ? 1 : 0;
}
// 5) Restore materials + cleanup
for(constmeshofregionMeshes) mesh.material= originalMats.get(mesh);
renderer.setRenderTarget(null);
rt.dispose();
returnmask; // can be used for hit-testing, outlining, or generating SVG 
offline
}
This approach leans on standard WebGL “picking” principles and typical engine capabilities (render targets +
pixel readback). 
Mobile and cross-platform options
If you go beyond PWA: - Unity supports runtime glTF import via glTFast (Unity package documentation).
- SceneKit  is a high-level Apple framework for importing/manipulating/rendering 3D assets (useful for
iOS-specific builds). 
- Flutter apps can embed Unity content via community packages (trade-off: heavier app size + pipeline
complexity). 
Performance and UX conventions
Performance-friendly defaults for an educational visualization: - Cache GLB assets aggressively (service
worker for PWA; local bundle for native), and keep textures modest. glTF is built for efficient loading, but
you still pay for triangles, textures, and overdraw. 
- Prefer fewer meshes with clear region IDs; if you need lots of segments, consider instancing or combining
static geometry while keeping a lightweight picking strategy.

=== PAGE 9 ===
- Dispose GPU resources properly when swapping models/materials; Three.js documentation notes (for
example) that image bitmaps are not auto-GC’d and require explicit disposal patterns. 
UX and safety conventions (especially for “scientifically accurate” claims): - Present outputs as “educational
visualization”  rather  than  diagnosis;  respiratory  parameters  vary  by  posture,  fitness,  disease,  and
measurement method. 
- Provide an accessible fallback (2D SVG) if WebGL fails; SVG/Canvas hit-testing is standardized and well-
supported.

The key convention here is that deformation parameters drive both rendering and selection/hit-testing so
the “selectable anatomy” stays glued to the animated anatomy. 
Brief snippets you asked for
Pack-years → exposure index (TS-style pseudocode):
// pack-years: packs/day * years; 1 pack = 20 cigarettes
functionpackYears(cigsPerDay: number, years: number) {
return(cigsPerDay/ 20) * years;
}
// Smooth saturating mapping (not a medical claim; just UI scaling)
functionexposureIndex(py: number, k = 0.12) {
return1 - Math.exp(-k * py);// 0..~1
}
Pack-year definition is standard (packs per day × years).
